# vagrant-aphpkb-config
Vagrant basic configuration and provision using an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS base box and installing and configuring Aphpkb

It doesn't actually work very well yet.

Todo

* reduce php install to those necessary to successfully run Aphpkb and cli scripts.
* create and provision demo database for Aphpkb, including support options, changelog, installation and post-installation guides.
* automate creation of Aphpkb Admin user
* keep track and report (in this readme) on usernames / passwords used during setup
